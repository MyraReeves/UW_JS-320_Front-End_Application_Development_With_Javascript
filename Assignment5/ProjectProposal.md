# Project Proposal

A fan website for the tv show "Black Sails" üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

## Basic Info:

**Title:** _"Governor Augustus Featherstone's Complete and Accurate, Totally Fictional Journal of Who's Who in Nassau Town Circa 1715."_

Explanatory note:  The named person (Featherstone) is one of the characters in the show who starts off as a pirate but finishes at the end of the series as a governor of Nassau because of his skills in accounting and record keeping. The project title is written in a manner that is reminiscent of how that fictional character might name a journal.

**Elevator Pitch:**

"Black Sails" is a loosely historical, action-adventure television series set in the Caribbean (and some scenes in England) a few decades before the U.S. fought for independence from Britain, featuring a mix of fictional pirates from the novel "Treasure Island" and real life historical figures (mostly pirates).  It loosely serves as an adult-level (nudity, violence, gore) prequel to "Treasure Island" and tells a complete story of richly complicated characters (especially Captain Flint and Long John Silver) across four television seasons. Despite featuring movie-quality costumes/sets, starring some award-winning actors, receiving favorable reviews from both critics and audiences, and winning awards for both visual effects and music/sound editing, popular knowledge about the show remains weak, possibly due to it having originally aired during the height of "Game of Thrones" popularity on a less popular channel (Starz).

Not only is there a general lack of fansites to promote enthusiasm about the show, there is also the opportunity to expand public knowledge about the real-life 18th Century history involved.  My website would be both for people who have never heard of the show (raising interest while keeping spoilers to a minimum, or at least making sure spoilers are clearly marked) and for existing fans who wish to learn more facts or just geek out in fun shared camaraderie. The timing for a new fansite of the show is especially good because Netflix only just added the show to their streaming platform last year.

## Header:

**Description:** The header will appear on all pages of the website.  It will consists of a title image and a dropdown menu.  The title image will be a link that will lead back to the homepage when clicked on.  The dropdown menu will contain links to all of the pages of the website, when hovered over.

**Wireframe:**

<br>

## Homepage:

**Description:** The homepage will use the ["Episodes List" section of the TVMaze API](https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/182/episodes) to generate the episode list on the righthand side of the page. A second API that will randomly generate a welcome message at the top of the page, similar to [this pirate API](https://pirate.monkeyness.com/api.html).  The videos on the lefthand side of the page will be the season preview trailers, using the "embed" codes provided by YouTube.

**Wireframe:**

## Stats page:

**Description:** The contents of this page will make use of the ["Show main information"](https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/182) section of the TVMaze API.

**Wireframe:**

## Cast page:

**Description:** Images and some basic information about each actor will be displayed by using the ["Cast"](https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/182/cast) section of the TVMaze API.

**Wireframe:**

<br>

## Characters page:

**Description:** The images and names on this page will be generated by accessing the ["Characters"](https://api.tvmaze.com/characters/49503) section of the TVMaze API.

TVMaze has summary description paragraphs about each character [(example)](https://www.tvmaze.com/characters/49503/black-sails-captain-james-flint) , but for some reason those descriptive summaries don't seem to be returned from the API call. ‚òπÔ∏è Therefore, I will need to find or build a second API to generate information about each character, such as those character descriptions.

Ideally, clicking on a character's image on this page will lead to another page with that information about the character, similar to how the Star Wars homework assignment operated.

## Podcast page

**Description:** When asked what sort of content she would most want on a fansite for a tv show (any show in general), a friend answered that she would enjoy learning more behind-the-scenes insights from the writers and cast.  Thankfully, the ["Fathoms Deep" podcast](https://commonroomradio.com/podcasts/fathoms-deep/) did just that for this show by interviewing the producers, writers, cast, and others! Since [Elfsight](https://elfsight.com/) offers a free widget that can easily embed a podcast player onto a website, I will use that to provide access for users to listen to the "Fathoms Deep" podcast on this page.

## Learning page

**Description:** When asked what sort of content he would most want on a fansite for "Black Sails," a different friend answered that he would enjoy learning more about the historical facts and figures who were portrayed in the show.  Thankfully, the Library of Congress seems to have several pirate-related historical documents/images [and an API to access them with](https://www.loc.gov/apis/). Since I am not currently sure how I could quickly set things up to search (and display on my website the results of) the entire LOC using whatever words the user types in, the most feasible alternative instead would probably be to set up a dropdown menu of pre-determined choices that responds by displaying onto the page the contents of whichever option is selected by the user. For example, one of the dropdown choices could be ["The Pirates Own Book"](https://www.loc.gov/item/16008172/), which (if selected by the user) would then display onto the screen [the Library of Congress image scans of that book](https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcmassbookdig.piratesownbook00ellm_0/?st=gallery) from the 1800s.

Since the majority of the show takes place in the Bahamas, it also makes sense to make one of the dropdown options be to learn facts about that country, which can be delivered onto the page via the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/Bahamas?fullText=true).

Since [a relatively nice image of a pirate-esque sailing ship exists in the public domain for free](https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/pictures/610000/velka/sail-ships-in-the-ocean-waves.jpg) I plan on setting up the page so that that image appears until a menu option is chosen.  Once a learning menu option is selected, that image div would be replaced by a new div containing the requested info.

## Plan:

Week 1:

* Planning
* Resource gathering

Week 2: 

* Create app, install dependencies, and adjust main.jsx and App.jsx files.
* Create the needed files (header and main skeletons of the 6 landing pages - Homepage, Stats, Cast, Characters, Podcast, and Learn More page).
* Set up the embeddable podcast widget and put it on the Podcast page.
* Code the needed API calls/results per page.
  * 1Ô∏è‚É£ The bulk of the Homepage, Stats, Cast, and Characters landing page should be finished first since they should be relatively fast/easy API-related pages to set up.
  * 2Ô∏è‚É£ Figuring out the [random pirate greeting generator](https://pirate.monkeyness.com/api/insult) on the homepage will probably take slightly more time, since it seems like I might need to create my own.  Therefore, tackling that should come second.
  * 3Ô∏è‚É£ I expect that setting up an info paragraph about each character (that would appear when the character's image is clicked on from the Characters page) might take some time as well, since I haven't yet found an API that returns that data (I might need to write it myself). If need be, I can omit that feature from the website since a page with just the character images/names (which [the TVMaze API can provide](https://api.tvmaze.com/characters/49505)) could suffice, but it would be nice if I can include it.  That is why solving this character info paragraph feature should come _after_ solving the homepage greeting situation.
  * 4Ô∏è‚É£ Using the Library of Congress API for the Learn More page (and then installing the dropdown menu to access it) seems like it will be the most time-consuming (and potentially hardest) part of the project. It should therefore come after finishing the other API-related pages.
* Use CSS as each page is created, to style the page.
* Any additional time remaining can be spent creating additional "Nice to Have" features

Week 3:

* Finish any lingering unfinished tasks from the prior week.
* Incorporate unit testing.
* Solve any errors/glitches that are occurring.
* Deploy onto publicly accessible web server.
* Perform basic user testing and adjust according to feedback.
* Complete any final CSS touches.
* Turn in the assignment for grading and present the project in class.

## "Nice to Have" Potential Extra Features

If there is enough extra time, it might be nice to create a page with a Vingt-Un game, since I already have experience from last semester with both coding the basic skeleton of one and with [a related API](https://www.deckofcardsapi.com/), assuming that API is CORS-compliant.

I also have been discussing with friends the idea of creating some sort of "favorites/wish list" functionality for perusing related merchandise on the internet, but that idea is far less developed. Since I am not yet sure how it would function nor how it would integrate into the rest of the website, it is far less likely to be tackled.  It would be better to finish polishing the rest of the website instead, but it seemed worth mentioning since it has remained a vague idea of another potential extra feature for the website.
